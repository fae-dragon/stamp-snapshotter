Stamp Snapshotter lets you snapshot your stamps in IdleOn from the IdleOn Toolbox data page.

Please follow these steps when using it or it won't work:
1. Go to IdleOn Toolbox (we are going to assume your IdleOn account is connected to IdleOn Toolbox)
2. Go to the "Data" tab in the nav bar
3. Click the dropdown for "Raw Game JSON"
4.  Once the Raw Game JSON dropdown is open, open up the Stamp Snapshotter extension
5. Click "Snapshot Stamps".  If all goes well, it should say "Snapshot Complete!"
6. Change some stamps in IdleOn (or wait for your No Stamp Left Behind to trigger)
7.  Wait for IdleOn Toolbox to update with your new data (or switch characters)
8. Take another snapshot by clicking Snapshot Stamps.
9.  Finally, click "Compare Stamp Snapshots" - if you've followed the instructions so far, it should list which stamps have changed between snapshots, and by how many levels.

If anything doesn't work, please re-check that you're following the instructions.  I didn't test extensively so if something weird happens good luck.
